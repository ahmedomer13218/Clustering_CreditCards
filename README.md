## Overview  
This project applies and evaluates three clustering methods:  
- **K-Means++**  
- **DBSCAN**  
- **Agglomerative Clustering**  

It explores the impact of data preprocessing (scaling, transformation) and dimensionality reduction on clustering results, with comprehensive evaluations using Silhouette Scores, WCSS, and visualizations.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nataliaole/cc-general-clustering).  

## Key Features  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Data exploration, feature cleaning, and imputation.  
   - Applied transformations (Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson, Log) and scaling (Standard, MinMax, Robust).  
   - Dimensionality reduction for improved clustering.  

2. **Clustering Techniques**  
   - **K-Means++**: Explored multiple transformation and scaling combinations, with WCSS and Silhouette Score evaluations to select the best clusters.  
   - **DBSCAN**: Tested different `eps` and `min_samples` combinations for optimal clustering.  
   - **Agglomerative Clustering**: Used dendrograms and Silhouette Scores to identify the best number of clusters, testing linkage methods (Ward, Complete, Average, Single).  

3. **Ready-to-Use Functions**  
   - Predefined functions for clustering tasks, making this notebook highly reusable for similar projects.
